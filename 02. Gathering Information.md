- Competitive Intelligence gathers information about competitors and their technologies

- Information gathering can be broken down to 7 steps
    - Unearth initial information
    - Locate Network Range
    - Ascertain Active Machines
    - Discover Open ports and access points
    - Detect operating systems
    - Uncover services on ports
    - Map the network
    
- Footprinting is the process of creating a blueprint of the organization
    - Whois
    - NSlookup
    - sam Spade
    - Google
    
- DNS Enumeration is locating all DNS servers and their records for the organization

- A company can have internal and external DNS servers

- Types of DNS Records
    - A (address) Maps host name to IP address
    - SOA (start of authority) Identifies DNS server responsible for the domain information
