- Types of scanning
    - Port Scanning : Determines open ports and services
    - Network Scanning : Identifies IP addresses on a network
    - Vulnerability Scanning : Determines known vulnerabilities on the system
    
- Well known ports: 0 - 1023

- Registered ports : 1024 - 49151

- Dynamic ports: 49152 - 65535

- Common port numbers and services
    - FTP 21
    - Telnet 23
    - HTTP 80
    - SMTP 25
    - POP3 110
    - HTTPS 443
    - SSH 22
    - SMB 445
    - DNS 53
    
- Scanning Methodology
    - Check for live systems
    - Check for open ports
    - Service Identification
    - Banner grabbing / OS fingerprinting
    - Vulnerability Scanning
    - Draw network diagrams of vulnerable host
    - Prepare proxies
    - Attack
    
 - Ping Sweeping checks for systems that are live on the network, which means they respond to probes and connection requests
 
 - Ping Sweep counter: Most IDS and IPS blocks ping responses so attack cant get an accurate picture
 
 - Port Scanning checks for open ports, and it involves probing each port to determine if they are open
 
 - Port Scan counter: IDS/IPS. Firewalls should be able to detect port scanning. Only open ports that are needed
 
 - `nmap` can efficiently do ping sweeps and port scanning, service identification and OS detection
 
 - A port can be open, filtered, or unfiltered
     - Open : port is open and accepts incoming requests to the port
     - Filtered: Firewall or network filter is screening the port and preventing knowledge if the port is open or not
     - Unfiltered: Port is determined to be closed, and not being filtered
    
- Common `nmap` options
    - `sT` TCP connect scan
    - `sS` SYN scan - stealth scan
    - `sF` FIN scan - FIN
    - `sX` XMAS scan - FIN, URG, PSH
    - `sN` NULL scan - no flags set
    - `sI` IDLE scan - uses spoofed IP address to send a SYN packet
    
- TCP three way handshake
    - `SYN` -->
    - <-- `SYN/ACK`
    - `ACK` -->

- TCP flags
    - `SYN` Synchornize, initiates connections
    - `ACK` Acknowledge, establishes connection
    - `PSH` Push, forwarding buffered data
    - `URG` Urgent, data in the packets must be processed quickly
    - `FIN` Finish, no more transmissions after this
    - `RST` Reset, resets the connection

- War-Dialing
   - Dialing modem numbers to find an open modem connection that provides remote access to network
   
- Banner grabbing and OS Fingerprinting
    - Banner grabbing is the process of opening a connection and reading the banner or response sent by the application
    - Many email, FTP, and web servers will respond to a telnet connection with the name and version of the software
    
- Enumeration occurs after scanning
    - Process of gathering usernames, machine names, network resources, shares and services
    - Objective is to identify user accounts or systems for use in hacking the system
    - `net view / domain`
    
- Null Sessions
    - Logging in to a system with no username or password

- NetBIOS enumeration
    - NetBIOS enumeration uses specific port numbers on the target machine.
    - Null sessions require ports 135, 137, 139 and/or 445
    - A counter measure is to close these ports on the system
    - Can be done by disabling SMB, disbaling NetBIOS over TCP/IP
    
- SNMP (Simple network management protocol) enumeration
    - Using SNMP to enumerate user accounts on a target system
    - SNMP employs SNMP agent, located on the networking device, and the SNMP management station which communicates with the agent
    - Almost all network infrastructure (routers, switches) contain an SNMP agent to manage the device
    - The SNMP management station sends requests to the agents, and the agents replies
    - SNMP has two passwords to access and configure the SNMP agent
    - First password is the `read community string`: this lets you view the configurations
    - Second password is the `read/write community strings`: reading and editing the configurations
    - `read` string is public, `read/write` string is private
    - Common loop hole is having the `read/write community string` left as the default
    - Counter measure is to remove the SNMP agents on the target system, and turn off the SNMP service
    - Else, change the passwords, or restict the SNMP connections
    
 - DNS Zone Transfer
     - A simple zone transfer performed with the `nslookup` command can enumerate lots of interesting network information
     - As a countermeasure, zone transfers can be blocked in the properties of the Windows DNS server
     - DNS zone transfers usually rely on **TCP port 53** instead of **UDP port 53**. If you see **TCP port 53** in use, it could tell you that someone is doing a zone transfer
     
## Essentials

- Know the 3 types of scanning and counter measures (port, network, vulnerability)

- Know how to determine which systems are alive on your network (ICMP ping sweeping)

- Know how to do scanning with `nmap`

- Understand uses and limitations of the different `nmap` scan types

- Understand the TCP 3 way handshake

- Know how to perform OS fingerprinting (banner grabbing)

- Anonymize using HTTP tunneling and IP spoofing

- Know how to enumerate user accounts through SMB, CIFS or NetBIOS
    - Use a firewall to block ports 135 and 139, 445 or patch the Registry to prevent null sessions
    - Turn off the SNMP services, or change the default read and read/write community names
    
## Quiz Notes

NetBIOS stands for Network basic input output system and is used in Windows for its file and printer sharing.

NetBIOS null sessions are a vulnerability found in the Common Internet File System (CIFS) or SMB
