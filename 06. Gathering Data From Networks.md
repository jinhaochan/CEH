- Sniffers present themselves at Layer 2 (frame) and Layer 3 (packet) of the OSI model 

- OSI model recap
    - APST(ND)P : sniffing happens at Network and Data layer
    
- Sniffers work by  capturing packets not destined for the sniffers system MAC address (promiscuous mode)

- Normally, systems only read and respond to traffic directed to it, but in promiscuous mode, the NIC reads all traffic

- Any protocols that don't support encryption can be sniffed: HTTP, POP3, SNMP, FTP

- Passive and Active Sniffing
    - Passive sniffing listens and captures traffic. Useful against a hub
    - Active sniffing launches an ARP spoofing and traffic-flooding attack against a switch
    
- Networks that are hubs or wireless, all hosts can see all traffic.

- Switched networks send traffic to the specific recipient only, thus it's more secure

- Another way to sniff traffic is through a span port, or port mirroring to duplicate all data on a physical switch port to another port

- Sniffing Counter Measures
    - Encryption prevents the data from being readable

- ARP
    - ARP allows the network to translate IP addresses to MAC addresses
    - When a host wants to talk to another machine, it needs it's MAC address
    - The switch first checks it's ARP cache if it has the machine's MAC address
    - If the switch does not, it does an ARP broadcast asking "who has this IP address"
    - When the machine with that IP address gets the broadcast, it replies with it's MAC address
    
- ARP poisoning
    - ARP poisoning uses ARP spoofing to send fake/spoofed ARP messages
    - The spoofed ARP message sends the attacker's MAC address, binding it to the legitimate IP address
    - All traffic will thus be sent to the attackers MAC address
    
- ARP Spoofing / Poisoning Countermeasures
    - To prevent ARP spoofing, permanently add the MAC address of the gateway to the ARP cache on a system
    - Doing so prevents a hacker from overwriting the ARP cache to perform ARP spoofing on the system but can be difficult to manage in a large environment because of the number of systems
    - Port-based security can be enabled on a switch to allow only one MAC address per switch port
    
- MAC Flooding and DNS Spoofing
    - MAC flooding floods the switch with so much traffic that it acts as a hub
    - DNS Poisoning changes the IP address in the DNS server
    - When a user requests for a URL, it redirects them to a malicous website instead
    - DNS server must validate DNS responses to ensure they come from authoritive sources
    
- Types of DNS spoofing
    - Intranet Spoofing
    - Internet Spoofing
    - Proxy Server DNS Poiosoning
    - DNS Cache Poisoning
