- Web server use HTTP and HTTPS to send data

- HTTP is an Application layer protocol (layer 6)

- Process
    - Client opens a connection to the webserver using port 80 or 443
    - Webserver receives a GET request from the client
    - Webserver responds with the HTML code to the client
    - Client receives the HTML code, and renders it on the browser
    
- Types of Web Server vulnerabilities
    - Misconfigured Web Server Software (Leaving everything to default settings)
    - OS and Application Bugs
    - Default Installation
 
- Banner grabbing gathers information about the webserver such as the OS, webserver software, and version

- Common Attacks
    - Directory Traversal (improper parsing of unicode)
    - Source Disclosure (source code of the server application can be obtained, performing reverse engineering)
    - Buffer Overflow
    
- Patch Management Techniques
    - Proper patch management involves choosing how patches are to be installed and verified, and testing those patches on a non-production network prior to installation
    
- Webserver Hardening Methods
    - Rename admin account
    - Disable default websites and FTP sites
    - Remove unused applications from the server
    - Disable directory browsing
    - Adding legal notice
    - Applying patches
    - Form validation checking
    - Disable remote administration
    - 404 error messages
    - Enable auditing and logging
    - Firewall between webserver and internet
    - Replace GET with POST when sending data to a webserver
    
- Web Application Vulnerabilities
    - Web applications are programs that reside on a web server to give the user functional-ity beyond just a website
    - A web application uses a client/server architecture, with a web browser as the client and the web server acting as the application server
    - Web applications are critical to the security of a system because they usually connect to a database
    - Web applications are essentially another door into a system and can be exploited to compromise the system
    
- Five stages of web application attack
    - Scanning
    - Info gathering
    - Testing
    - Planning attack
    - Launching attack
    
- Web application threats
    - Cross site scripting
    - SQLi
    - Command Injection
    - Cookie Poisoning and Snooping
    - Buffer overflow
    - Authentication Hijacking
    - Directory Traversal

- Web based Authentication Types
    - Basic: username and password in clear text
    - Digest: Hashes the credentials and uses challenge-response model for authentication
    - NTLM Auth
    - Certification-Based Auth: x.509 certificate for public/private key
    - Token-Based Auth: OTP
    - Biometric Auth
    
- Password Attacks
    - Dictionary
    - Brute force
    - Hybrid
