- SQL injection occurs when an application processes user-provided data to create a SQL statement without first validating the input

- Dynamic SQL is a term used to mean SQL code that is generated by the web application before it is executed
    - `SQLCommand = "SELECT Username FROM Users WHERE Username = '"`
    - A Hacker can exploit the dynamic SQL by injecting a malicious string
    
- SQLi Countermeasures
    - Insufficient validation is the root cause of SQLi
    - Make sure to validate all input strings from users
    - Minimzie privileges of user connection to the database
    - Make sure error messages are not so verbose to give the hackers more info
    - Reject, validate, sanitize
    
- Buffer Overflows
    - Stack Overflow
    - Heap Overflow
    
- Stack and Heaps are storage locations for user supplied variables within the running program
    - Stack is a static memory space
    - Heap is a dynamic memory space
    
- Stack Overflow
    - Enter a long enough variable to exhuast the amount of memory in the stack
    - Enter more data than the allocated buffer and overwrite the next memory space
    - Instruct the PC to go to your malicious code instead
    
- Buffer Overflow Countermeasures
    - A hacker can use NOP (NOP sled) to lead to their malicious code
    - An IDS can detect the series of NOPs sent
    - hacker can randomly replace some of the NOP instructions with equivalent pieces of code, such as `x++,x-;?NOPNOP`
    - This example of a mutated buffer overflow attack can bypass detection by an IDS
    - Should not use the built-in strcpy(), strcat(), and streadd() C/C++ functions because they are susceptible to buffer overflows
