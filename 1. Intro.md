- Purpose of Ethical Hacking, uses the same tools as malicious actors to find security weaknesses in systems. Patches are then applied to prevent attacks

- Cracker = Malicious Actor

- Ethical Hackers perform pen test to assess CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity + Availability

- Threat = External threat from environment 

- Vulnerability = Interal weakness in controls

- Exploit = Leveraging Vulnerability

- 5 Phases of pen testing: Reconnaissance --> Scanning --> Gaining Access --> Maintaining Access --> Covering Tracks
   - Passive / Active Reconnasissance
       - Passive : Sniffing
       - Active : Probing
   - Scanning
       - Ping Sweep
       - NMap
       - Port Scanners
       - Want to get information such as OS, User Accounts, IP addresses, Computer Names
   - Gaining Access
       - Vulnerabilities are exposed during Reconnaisance and Scanning
       - These vulnerabilities are then exploited
   - Maintaining Access
       - Hackers harden the system from other hackers
       - Install backdoors and rootkits
   - Covering Tracks
       - Remove logs (system logs, application logs, network logs)
       
- Testing Types
    - Black Box: No prior knowledge of infrastructure
    - White Box: Has prior knowledge of infrastructure
    
- Security, Functionality, Ease of Use triangle trade-off

-   An ethical hacking report 
    - Information on the hacking activities performed
    - Network or system vulnerabilities discovered
    - Countermeasures that should be implemented
