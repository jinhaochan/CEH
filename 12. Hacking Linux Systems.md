- Shells are terminals where users enter their commands
    - C Shell (csh)
    - Bourne Shell (sh)
    - Bourne Again Shell (bash)
    - tcsh
    - etc...

- Directories and files
    - bin (binary executable files)
    - sbin (system binaries)
    - etc (config files)
    - include (include files)
    - lib (library files)
    - src (source files)
    - proc (transient file system)
    
- Commands
    - arp (view arp table of MAC addresses to IP)

    - ipconfig
    - ...
    
- Reason for compiling your own Linux kernel
    - You may have some hardware that is so new that there’s no kernel module for it
    - You may have come across some kind of bug that is fixed in a revision of the operating Ûnsystem
    - You may have some new software application that requires a newer version of the oper-Ûnating system
    
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    - A command line compiler that takes a source code and makes it into an executable
    
- Linux Kernel Modules (LKM)
    - Add functionality to the kernel without recompiling it
    
- Linux Hardening Methods
    - Physical Access
    - Strong passwords
    - Whitelist network traffic `Cat “All:All”>> /etc/hosts.deny`
    - Remove unused services
    - Apply patches
    - Setup and enable IP tables
    - Hostbased IDS (HIDS)
    - Secure Bootloader
    - Enable Single-user mode password
    
- Securing Local File Systems
    - File or Directory Permissions
    - Encryption
    - Proper Mount options
    
- Configuring and Disabling Services
    - Remove / Disable all unused services
    - Use secure versions of daemons
    - Don't use root or sudo, but special user accounts
    - Set maximum number of instances for services
    - Set access controls and logging for all services
    
- Securing Root Account
    - Secure root password
    - Restrict SU usage
    - Prevent Direct root logins
    
- Defining User Account Password Selection
    - Setup default user initialization files in `/etc/skel`
    - Ensure that administrative and other system accounts to which no one should logon to have disabled password and `/bin/false`
    - Remove unneeded default accounts
    
- Securing Remote Authentication
    - Disable `/etc/host.equiv` and `.rhost` password-less authentication
    - Use ssh and its related commands for all remote user access. Disable rlogin, rsh, telnet, Ûnftp, rcp, and so on
    
- Perform System Monitoring
    - Configure the syslog facility. Send or copy syslog messages to a central syslog server for redundancy
    - Enable process accounting
    - Install Tripwire, configure it, and record system baseline data. Write the data to removable media and then remove it from the system. Finally, configure Tripwire to run on a daily basis
   
- Misc
    - Remove any remaining source code for the kernel or additional software packages from the system
