- IDS inspect traffic and look for known signatures of attacks or unusual behavior patterns

- A packet sniffer views and monitors traffic and is a built-in component of an IDS

- IPS initiate countermeasures such as blocking traffic when suspected traffic flow is detected

- Two main types of IDS
    - Host based (HIDS)
        - Host-based IDSs (HIDSs) are applications that reside on a single system or host and filter traffic or events based on a known signature list
    - Network based (NIDS)
        - Used solely for intrusion detection purposes to detect all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that can’t be detected by a conventional firewall
        
- A signature is a pattern used to identify either a single packet or a series of packets that, when combined, execute an attack
    - A hacker can evade an IDS by changing the traffic so that it does not match a known signature
    - A hacker can break an attack up into several smaller packets to pass through an IDS but, when reassembled at the receiving station, will result in a compromise of the system. This is known as session splicing
    - Other methods of evading detection involve inserting extra data, obfuscating addresses or data by using encryption, or desynchronizing and taking over a current client’s session

- Snort Rules and Output
    - The command to install and run Snort is `snort –l c:\snort\log –c C:\snort\etc\snort.conf –A console`
    
- Two components of Snort
    - Snort Engine
        - IDS Detection Engine
    - Snort Rules
        - language to describe traffic to be collected
        
- The Snort IDS Engine and rules can be downloaded from `snort.org`

- Snort Configuration
    - Snort has one configuration file: `snort.conf` that resides in `/etc/snort`
    - Network variables
    - Preprocessors
    - Postprocessors
    - Rules

- Snort rules are used to generate alerts based on the traffic that is viewed by the IDS processing engine

- Firewall Types and Honeypot Evasion Techniques
    - A firewall is a software program or hardware appliance that allows or denies access to a network
    - A `perimeter hardware firewall` appliance (Figure 13.2) is set up either at the network edge where a trusted network connects to an untrusted network, such as the Internet, or between networks
    - A `software firewall` protects a personal computer, a system, or a host from unwanted or malicious packets entering the network interface card (NIC) from the network

- A honeypot is a decoy box residing inside your network demilitarized zone (DMZ), used to trap or aid in locating hackers, or to draw them away from the real target system

- The honeypot is a decoy system that a malicious attacker might try to attack; software on the system can log information about the attacker such as the IP address

- The best location for a honeypot is in front of the firewall on the DMZ, making it attractive to hackers

- A honeypot with a static address is designed to look like a real production server

- The easiest way to bypass a firewall is to compromise a system on the trusted or internal side of the firewall

- The compromised system can then connect through the firewall, from the trusted to the untrusted side, to the hacker’s system (inside out)

- A common method of doing this is to make the compromised system connect to the hacker with destination port 80, which looks just like a web client connecting to a web server through the firewall. This is referred to as a reverse WWW shell
