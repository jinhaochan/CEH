- Two Types of encryption
    - Symmetric Key Encryption
        - Same key used to encrypt and decrypt the message
    - Asymmetric Key Encryption
        - Public/Private key
        - Encryption by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key
        - Encryption by the private key can only be decrypted by the public key
        
- Strengths of Symmetric key
    - Speed

- Weakness of Symmetric Key
    - Same key used to encrypt and decrypt. The key can be leaked
    - Scalability
    - The fact that it does not provide nonrepudiation, meaning the sender’s identity can be proven
    
- To use asymmetric encryption, there needs to be a method for transferring public keys. The typical technique is to use X.509 digital certificates
    - A certificate is a file of information that identifies a user or a server, and contains the organization name, the organization that issued the certificate, and the user’s email address, country, and public key
    - When a server and a client require a secure encrypted communication, they send a query over the network to the other party, which sends back a copy of the certificate. 
    - The other party’s public key can be extracted from the certificate. A certificate can also be used to uniquely identify the holder
    
- The weakness of asymmetric key encryption is that the process is slow and typically requires a significantly longer key. It’s only suitable for small amounts of data due to its slow operation

- Stream Ciphers vs Block Ciphers

- Block ciphers are encryption ciphers that operate by encrypting a fixed amount, or “block” of data
    - The message is divided into blocks of bits
    - Blocks are then put through one or more of the following scrambling methods
        - Substitution
        - Transposition
        - Confusion
        - Diffusion
        - S-boxes
        
- Stream Ciphers encrypts single bits of data as a continuous stream of data bits
    - Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers
    - The stream cipher then combines a plain text bit with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream by means of an XOR (exclusive OR) operation
    
- Generating Public and Private Keys
    - When a client and a server use asymmetric cryptography, both create their own pairs of keys for a total of four keys
        - Server’s public key
        - Server’s private key
        - Client’s public key
        - Client’s private key
    - A public key infrastructure (PKI) is necessary in order to create digital certificates
    - PKI is a framework that consists of hardware; software; policies that exist to manage, create, store, and distribute keys; and digital certificates
   
- The important parts of the PKI infrastructure are as follows
    - Digital certificates 
    - Certificate authorities
    - Certificate generation and destruction
    - Key management
    
- CAs are the glue that binds the public key infrastructure together. They are essentially neutral third-party organizations that provide notarization services for digital certificates
   
- Crypto Algorithms
    - MD5
        - A hashing algorithm that uses a random-length input to generate a 128-bit digest
    - SHA
        - SHA is also a message digest, which generates a 160-bit digest of encrypted data. SHA takes slightly longer than MD5 and is considered a stronger encryption
        - SHA-0: outputs 160 bits digest
        - SHA-1: outputs 160 bits digest
        - SHA-2: outputs 256/512 bits digest
    - RC4/5
        - Symmetric encryption stream cipher
        - RC5 is the next-generation algorithm: it uses a variable block size and variable key size
    - Blowfish
        - a 64-bit block cipher
    - MAC (Message Authentication Code)
        - MACs require the sender and receiver to share a secret key
    - HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code)
        - designed to be immune to the multicollision attack
        
- Cyrpographic Attacks
    - Cipher Text–Only Attack
        - This attack requires the attacker to obtain several messages encrypted using the same encryption algorithm.
        - The attacker attempts to crack the code by looking for patterns and using statistincal analysis.
    - Known–Plain Text Attack
        - This attack requires the attacker to have the plain text and cipher text of one or more messages.
        - The goal is to discover the key. 
        - This attack can be used if you know a portion of the plain text of a message.
    - Chosen–Plain Text Attack
        - This type of attack is carried out when an attacker has the plain text messages of their choosing encrypted.
        - An attacker can analyze the cipher text output of the encryption.
    - Chosen–Cipher Text Attack
        - This type of attack is carried out when the attacker can decrypt portions of the cipher text message of their choosing. 
        - The attacker can use the decrypted portion of the message to discover the key.
    - A replay attack occurs when the attacker can intercept cryptographic keys and reuse them at a later date to either encrypt or decrypt messages to which they may not have access.
    - A brute-force attack involves trying all possible combinations (such as keys or pass-words) until the correct solution is identified. Brute-force attacks are usually successful but require time and are usually costly
