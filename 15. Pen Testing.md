- A vulnerability or security assessment only identifies the potential vulnerabilities 

- Whereas a pen test tries to gain access to the network

- An example of a security assessment is looking at a door and thinking if that door is unlocked it could allow someone to gain unauthorized access, whereas a pen test tries to open the door to see where it leads

- There are two types of security assessments: external and internal assessments.
    - An external assessment tests and analyzes publicly available information, conducts network scanning and enumeration, and runs exploits from outside the network perimeter, usually via the Internet. 
    - An internal assessment is performed on the network from within the organization, with the tester acting either as an employee with some access to the network or as a black hat with no knowledge of the environment.

- An organization employing an assessment term must specify the scope of the assessment, including what is to be tested and what is not to be tested
    - A service-level agreement (SLA) should be defined to determine any actions that will be taken in the event of a serious service disruption
    
- Pen Testing has 3 steps
    - Preattack
        -  Reconnaissance or data gathering
    - Attack
        - Tools can range from exploitive to responsive
        - Penetrating the Perimeter
        - Acquiring the Target
        - Escalating Privileges
        - Executing, Implanting, and Retracting
    - Postattack
        - Restoring the system to normal pretest configurations, which includes removing files, cleaning Registry entries if vulnerabilities were created, and removing shares and connections
