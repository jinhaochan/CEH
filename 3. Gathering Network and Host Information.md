- Types of scanning
    - Port Scanning : Determines open ports and services
    - Network Scanning : Identifies IP addresses on a network
    - Vulnerability Scanning : Determines known vulnerabilities on the system
    
- Well known ports: 0 - 1023

- Registered ports : 1024 - 49151

- Dynamic ports: 49152 - 65535

- Common port numbers and services
    - FTP 21
    - Telnet 23
    - HTTP 80
    - SMTP 25
    - POP3 110
    - HTTPS 443
    - SSH 22
    - SMB 445
    - DNS 53
    
- Scanning Methodology
    - Check for live systems
    - Check for open ports
    - Service Identification
    - Banner grabbing / OS fingerprinting
    - Vulnerability Scanning
    - Draw network diagrams of vulnerable host
    - Prepare proxies
    - Attack
    
 - Ping Sweeping checks for systems that are live on the network, which means they respond to probes and connection requests
 
 - Ping Sweep counter: Most IDS and IPS blocks ping responses so attack cant get an accurate picture
 
 - Port Scanning checks for open ports, and it involves probing each port to determine if they are open
 
 - Port Scan counter: IDS/IPS. Firewalls should be able to detect port scanning. Only open ports that are needed
 
 - `nmap` can efficiently do ping sweeps and port scanning, service identification and OS detection
 
 - A port can be open, filtered, or unfiltered
     - Open : port is open and accepts incoming requests to the port
     - Filtered: Firewall or network filter is screening the port and preventing knowledge if the port is open or not
     - Unfiltered: Port is determined to be closed, and not being filtered
