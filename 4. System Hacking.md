- Passive online: Eavesdropping, traffic sniffing, man in the middle, replay attack (intercepts the password enroute to the authentication server, captures it and resends it later)

- Active online: Guessing password, brute forcing

- Offline: Dictionary attack

- Non-electronic: shoulder surfing, social engineering

- LAN Manager Hash (NT LAN Manager [NTLM])
    - Hashes passwords in transit on the network
    - First converts everything to uppercase
    - Null Padded to make it 14 Characters long
    - Split into half, and each half is hashed separately, concating them together later
    - If the password is seven characters or fewer, the second half of the hash will always be `AAD3B435B51404EE`
    
- SAM file in Windows system contains usernames and hashed password
    - `Windows\system32\config`
    - Locked when operating system is running
    
- Boot an alternate OS like Linux from thumbdrive, and you can access this file

- Redirecting SMB Logon to the Attacker Computer
    - Hacker must sniff the NTLM responses from the authentication server and trick the victim into attempting Windows authentication with the attacker’s computer
    - Send the victim an email message with an embedded link to afraudulent SMB server
    - When the link is clicked, the user unwittingly sends their credentials over the network
    
- SMB Relay Attack
    - When a victim client connects to the fraudulent server, the MITM server intercepts the call, hashes the password, and passes the connection to the victim server
    - Counter measures include signing the each block of the SMB communication
    
- NetBIOS DoS
    - A NetBIOS denial-of-service (DoS) attack sends a NetBIOS Name Release message to the NetBIOS Name Service on a target Windows systems and forces the system to place its name in conflict so that the name can no longer be used
    - This essentially blocks the client from participating in the NetBIOS network and creates a network DoS for that system

- Escalating Privileges (third step in pentesting)
    - After escalting Privilegs, we execute applications to tamper with the system
    
- Rootkits
    - Kernel level RK
        - Replaces/modifies the kernel code to hide backdoors
        - Done through device 
    - Library level RK
    - Application level RK
