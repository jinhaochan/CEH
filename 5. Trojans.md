- Trojans and backdoors are types of malware used to infect and compromise computer systems

- Trojans are often downloaded along with another program or software package

- A backdoor is a program or a set of related programs that a hacker installs on a target system to allow access to the system at a later time
    - Adding a new service is the most common technique to disguise backdoors in the Windows operating system
    - Hacker installs the backdoor, which adds a new service and gives it an inconspicuous name
    
- Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a class of backdoors used to enable remote control over a compromised machine
    - RATs hook themselves into the victim operating system and always come packaged with two files
        - Server: installed in the infected machine
        - Client: used by the intruder to control the compromised system
        
- Overt vs Covert Channels
    - Overt channel is the normal and legitimate way that programs communicate within a computer system or network
    - Covert channel uses programs or communications paths in ways that were not intended
    - Some covert channels rely on a technique called tunneling, which lets one protocol be carried over another protocol
    
- Reverse Connections
    - Reverse-connections let an attacker access a machine on the internal network from the outside
    - On a regular intervals, the internal server tries to access the external system to pick up commands
    - If the attacker has typed something into the master system, this command is retrieved and executed on the internal system

- Wrappers are software packages that can be used to deliver a Trojan

-  Windows File Protection (WFP)
    - Prevents the replacement of protected files
    - WFP checks the file integrity when an attempt is made to overwrite a SYS, DLL, OCX, TTF, or EXE file
    
- Viruses and worms can be used to infect a system and modify a system to allow a hacker to gain access
    - Virus needs a carrier to spread
    - Worms do not need a carrier to spread

- List of Viruses
    - Polymorphic Viruses These viruses encrypt the code in a different way with each infection and can change to different forms to try to evade detection.
    - Stealth Viruses These viruses hide the normal virus characteristics, such as modifying the original time and date stamp of the file so as to prevent the virus from being noticed as a new file on the system.
    - Fast and Slow Infectors These viruses can evade detection by infecting very quickly or very slowly. This can sometimes allow the program to infect a system without detection by an antivirus program.
    - Sparse Infectors These viruses infect only a few systems or applications.
    - Armored Viruses These viruses are encrypted to prevent detection.
    - Multipartite Viruses These advanced viruses create multiple infections.
    - Cavity (Space-Filler) Viruses These viruses attach to empty areas of files.
    - Tunneling Viruses These viruses are sent via a different protocol or encrypted to prevent detection or allow it to pass through a firewall.
    - Camouflage Viruses These viruses appear to be another program.
    - NTFS and Active Directory Viruses These viruses specifically attack the NT file system or Active Directory on Windows systems
