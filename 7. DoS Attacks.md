- DoS makes the system slower by overloading the system

- Session hijacking crates a temporary DoS for the end user when the attack takes over his session

- DoS vs DDoS
    - Single vs Distributed attacks
    
- The goal of a DoS isnt to gain unauthorized access or data, but to deny services to users
    - Flood network with traffic
    - Disrupt connection between machines
    - Prevent an individual from accessing the service
    - Disrupt a service to a system or person
    
- DDoS can be perpetrated by Bots, or a Botnet
    - Master
    - Slave
    - Victim
    
- Two Phases
    - Intrusion phase: the attacker compromises weak systems around different places or networks and installs a DDoS tool
    - Attach phase: The slave systems are activated to attack the victim
    
- Smurf Attack
    - Sends large amounts of ICMP Echo (ping) that are broadcasted to a network using the IP broadcast address
    - The ICMP packets are spoofed with the source address of a victim
    - The devices on the computer network will then reply the ping message to the victim machine
    
- SYN flood
    - Sends TCP connection requests faster than the machine can process them
    - The attack creates random source addresses for each packet, and sets the SYN flag to request a new connection
    - The victim responds to the request, and waits for the ACK, which never arrives
    - SYN, ACK-SYN, ACK
    - When the connection table is full, new requests are ignored
    
- SYN flood can be detected through `netstat` command

- SYN flood can be prevented using SYN Cookies and RST Cookies
    - SYN Cookies s ensure the server does not allocate system resources until a successful three-way handshake has been completed
    - RST Cookies works by the server responds to the client SYN frame with an incorrect SYN ACK
    - The client should then generate an RST packet telling the server that something is wrong
    - The server knows the client is valid and will now accept incoming connections from that client normally
    - Micro Blocks prevent SYN floods s by allocating only a small space in memory for the connection record
    - Stack Tweaking involves changing the TCP/IP stack to prevent SYN flood

- Session Hijacking
    - Session hijacking is when a hacker takes control of a user session after the user has suc-cessfully authenticated with a server
    -  Involves an attack identifying the current session IDs of a client/server communication
    -  Made possible by tools that perform sequence-number prediction
    - 
    
- Three Steps to Session Hijacking
    - Tracking the session: Identifies an open session, and predicts the sequence number of the next packet
    - Desynchronizing the Connection: Hacker sends a TCP RST or FIN to the user to close the their session
    - Injecting the Attacker's Packet: Hacker sends a TCP packet to the server with the predicted sequence number, thus switching the session to the attacker
    
- Active Session Hijacking = The act of taking over

- Passive Session Hijacking = Merely observing the traffic == Sniffing

- Sequence Prediction
    - Within the three-way handshake, the increment value is 1
    - In normal data communications, the increment value equals the size of the data in bytes (for example, if you transmit 45 bytes of data, the ACK responds using the incoming packet’s SN plus 45)
    - Hackers generate packets using a spoofed IP address of the system that had a session
    - hacking tools issue packets with the SNs that the target system is expecting
    - But the hacker’s packets must arrive before the packets from the client system whose connection is being hijacked
    - This is accomplished by flooding the trusted system with packets or sending an RST packet to the client system so that it is unavailable to send packets to the server system
    
- Newer operating systems have attempted to secure themselves from session hijacking by using pseudo-random number generators to calculate the ISN, making the sequence number harder to guess
    - However, this security measure is ineffective if the attacker is able to sniff packets, which gives all the information required to perform this attack
    
- Preventing Session Hijacking
    - The most effective protection is encryption, such as Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)
    - Even if hackers can sniff your traffic, it's encrypted
    - SSH, HTTPS
    - Reducing methods to get into your network (disabling remote access)
    - VPN
