- DoS makes the system slower by overloading the system

- Session hijacking crates a temporary DoS for the end user when the attack takes over his session

- DoS vs DDoS
    - Single vs Distributed attacks
    
- The goal of a DoS isnt to gain unauthorized access or data, but to deny services to users
    - Flood network with traffic
    - Disrupt connection between machines
    - Prevent an individual from accessing the service
    - Disrupt a service to a system or person
    
- DDoS can be perpetrated by Bots, or a Botnet
